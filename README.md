# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Scott Lai. I'm a software developer based in Vancouver, BC.
I'm currently studying Computer Science at [@sfu](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html).
I used to work at [@aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) for over 2 years. Previously, I worked
at [@gratifypay](https://www.gratifypay.com/). I like creating stuffs with
TypeScript and Kotlin, though I can tolerate Java :P

Feel free to reach out or check out my projects :D
